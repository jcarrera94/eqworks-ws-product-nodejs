      <h2>Welcome to my solution</h2>
      <p>I'm a naturally curious and logic-oriented individual. I tend to dive into coding with passion as I am constantly learning and trying to come up with the most efficient solution. It wasn't until last year when I realized my passion was in coding and started my journey in the web development industry. After a few months of diving into javascript on my own I decided to take an extra step. So, I took a full stack web development bootcamp and became exceptional at problem solving and getting the knack of logic oriented thinking. Although it was only for 4 months, it involved 16+ hour days for 7 days a week, which simulates having experience for a lot longer. The grind of day after day was to learn most of the technologies mentioned in my <a  className="click-me" href="https://www.canva.com/design/DADxet3yiLk/Vy89cy3fPcZ89zjiZ7lAlg/view?utm_content=DADxet3yiLk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton">resume</a>.</p>
      <p>This tells you that I am willing to take new challenges, whether is learning a new programming language in just a few weeks to getting out of my comfort zone and completely adapt to a new way of learning. I know I have a long way to go and with this internship I can improve my skills inmensly. Working on the work sample made me realize that I truly enjoy coding and looking for new technologies. Frankly I had never worked with react router before, but for this assignment I decided to incorporate it since it was an opportunity to learn a new library and it fits great to the way I decided to showcase my solution. Working at EQworks could really benefit me to strengthen and further develop my foundation and technical skills for my professional career. Simultaneously, by giving me the opportunity to work with the amazing team and cutting edge tech stack EQworks offers, you would be gaining a creative mind and full of work ethic web developer that is always seeking for more efficient and creative solutions.
